A Tcl Shell for Vim using the integrated tcl interpreter.

Creates a new buffer and window that resembles a shell. Tcl code can be entered
and is executed once Enter is pressed.

Requires Vim be compiles with the +tcl feature.

Provides two commands:
- TclShell opens the Tcl Shell Window.
- TclEval evaluates Tcl code. This command can evaluate provided Tcl code, the
  entire file (which is transformed to "source FILE") or visual ranges (whole
  lines only). 

Has the key mapping "<Leader>tcl" to open the Tcl Shell window and execute
visually selected Tcl code. (Note: "<Leader>" is normally mapped to "\".)
